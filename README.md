# Math323-Summer24
Hello and welcome to this repo. Here I have uploaded all of the notes that I have taken from the Summer 2024 session of Math 323, with Prof. Armel Kelome. I will continue to monitor this repo indefinitely; if you notice any errors, please contact me at either [my university student email](mailto:enci.chen@mail.mcgill.ca) or [my personal email](mailto:kindness_c@outlook.com).

I wrote all of these notes in Obsidian, a Markdown editor, with the help of the community plugin Latex Suite to increase my LaTeX-ing speed. Any pictures that I include in the notes can be found in the ```attachments``` folder. I frequently use callouts (unfortunately, this is a feature that is only supported on Obsidian) to block off my notes into sections: definitions, examples, theorems/propositions, proofs, remarks, and asides. The CSS snippets that I made for these callouts are in the file ```callouts.css```. If you would like to use these snippets on your Obsidian, you can download ```callouts.css```, go to Settings > Appearance > CSS snippets, and apply the CSS file.
